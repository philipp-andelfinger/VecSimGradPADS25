Source code for the experiments in the paper "Slight Stochastic Shifts Suffice: Cross-Trajectory Vectorized Estimation of Simulation Gradients", accepted at ACM SIGSIM PADS'25

vfloat types and vectorized nested branching via predication are implemented in 'vfloat.hpp'.

Usage:

`./compile_and_compare.py` to generate the data for Fig. 3 and 4

`./run_opt_sweep.sh` to generate the data visualized in Figure 5 (uses executables generated during the previous step)
